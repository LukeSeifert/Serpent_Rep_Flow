# Serpent_Rep_Flow

This repository contains the example cases and scripts used in an associated paper.

The directories containing the example cases are found in files named with "Case" attached to their name. The directory containing the scripts is in the "scripts" directory. It contains scripts for both the single and multiple flow variations. For simple use, make changes to the "input" scripts and run the "analysis" scripts.
